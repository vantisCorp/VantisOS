## Security Features

### VantisOS Security Architecture

VantisOS is built with security as a first-class principle:

#### 1. Formal Verification

- **Kernel Components**: All critical kernel components are formally verified
- **Proof Tools**: Verus and Kani for Rust code verification
- **Properties Proven**: Memory safety, type safety, absence of data races
- **Verification Status**: See [VERIFICATION_STATUS.md](docs/reports/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md)

#### 2. Microkernel Design

- **Minimal TCB**: Trusted Computing Base is minimal by design
- **User-Space Services**: Most services run in user space
- **Capability-Based Security**: Fine-grained access control
- **IPC Isolation**: Strong isolation between processes

#### 3. Memory Safety

- **Rust**: Memory-safe language with no null pointer dereferences
- **No Buffer Overflows**: Compile-time prevention of buffer overflows
- **Bounds Checking**: All array access is bounds-checked
- **Ownership System**: Prevents data races and use-after-free

#### 4. Secure Boot

- **TPM 2.0 Integration**: Hardware-backed attestation
- **Signed Binaries**: All binaries are cryptographically signed
- **Chain of Trust**: From bootloader to applications
- **Panic Protocol**: Secure erase on panic (Wraith Mode)

#### 5. Hardware Security

- **IOMMU**: DMA attack prevention
- **SMEP/SMAP**: Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention
- **NX Bit**: No-Execute bit for non-executable pages
- **ASLR**: Address Space Layout Randomization

#### 6. Network Security

- **Rust-Native TCP/IP**: Memory-safe network stack
- **eBPF/XDP**: In-kernel packet filtering for anti-DDoS
- **Tor Integration**: Anonymized networking (Wraith Mode)
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All IPC is encrypted

#### 7. Continuous Security Testing

- **OSS-Fuzz**: 24/7 fuzzing of security-critical components
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security analysis in CI/CD
- **Vantis Guard**: AI-powered code review for security issues
- **Live Trust Dashboard**: Real-time security metrics
